# Thai grocery API

# What is the Thai grocery API?

This API is a collection of Thai groceries that are branded with Thai grocery
products that include product name, brand, info, image, ingredients, weight, and
pricing. I intend to add more products in the future.

**Base URL**
[https://thai-grocery-api.herokuapp.com](https://thai-grocery-api.herokuapp.com)

**Path**

```
api/thai-grocery-product/
```

**Making a request** To make a request for the product, you'd append the product
index path to the base url e.g.

```
https://thai-grocery-api.herokuapp.com/api/thai-grocery-product/product
```

JSON

```
